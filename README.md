# How to Extract CMEOfflineKit

Follow these steps to extract the CMEOfflineKit archive using 7-Zip:

## Step 1: Install 7-Zip
If you donâ€™t already have 7-Zip installed, download and install it from [7-Zip's official website](https://www.7-zip.org/).

## Step 2: Gather All Split Files
Ensure you have all parts of the split archive in the same folder. The files will typically be named something like:
- `CMEofflineKit.zip.001`
- `CMEofflineKit.zip.002`

## Step 3: Extract the Split Archive
1. Right-click on the first part of the split archive (e.g., `CMEofflineKit.zip.001`).
2. From the context menu, select **7-Zip > Extract Here** (or **Extract to "CMEofflineKit"** to create a new folder).
3. 7-Zip will automatically detect the other parts (e.g., `.002`, `.003`, etc.) and combine them during extraction.
4. The extraction process will begin, and 7-Zip will combine all parts into the original files or folder.

## Step 4: Check the Extracted Files
Once extraction is complete, you should see the extracted files in the same location or in the newly created folder. If everything was extracted correctly, you can open and use the files as needed.
